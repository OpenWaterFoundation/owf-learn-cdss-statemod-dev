## Colorado's Decision Support System

Colorado's Decision Support System ([CDSS, cdss.state.co.us](http://cdss.state.co.us))
has been developed to answer important questions about Colorado's water resources.
CDSS efforts are led by the [Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)](http://cwcb.state.co.us)
and [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us).

One component of CDSS is the StateMod water allocation model,
which simulates water system operations under Colorado's prior appropriation water right system.
Because Colorado's water systems are complex, StateMod software and datasets are also complex.

In late 2016, the Open Water Foundation began the effort to move StateMod and other CDSS software to open source licensing
and establish open source software projects, and this documentation is one project outcome.

## Open Water Foundation

The Open Water Foundation (OWF, [openwaterfoundation.org](http://openwaterfoundation.org)) is a social enterprise
501(c)3 nonprofit that focuses on developing and supporting open source software to make better
decisions about water resources.  OWF is providing technical resources and management to
transition StateMod and other CDSS software to a sustainable open source project.

OWF has created this website as a prototype to facilitate helping people understand StateMod development issues
as the software moves to open source licensing.

## Learn StateMod (for Software Developers)

This website is intended as a companion to the StateMod source code repository and is the source of
information for software developers that support and enhance StateMod.
