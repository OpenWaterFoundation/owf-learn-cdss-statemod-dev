# Running StateMod

StateMod is a command line program.
The StateMod GUI can be used as a graphical interface; however, the GUI is not typically used extensively during StateMod development/testing.

The StateMod program provides functionality to perform several main tasks, as controlled by command line parameters:

* -baseflow - generate natural flow time series by removing regulated system impacts
* -baseflowx - 
* -check - check the model input without making a run
* -conditions
* -contact
* -help
* -report
* -simulate - perform a full simulation
* -simulatex - perform a full simulation
* -test
* -update - perform a full simulation
* -version
* -warranty - need to replace with open source license language

Need to fill this out and explain what is normally done during development and testing.
