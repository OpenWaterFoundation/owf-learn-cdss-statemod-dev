# Learn StateMod (for Software Developers)

This documentation is the developer manual for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) StateMod water allocation model software.

If you are reading this documentation, you have an interest in learning how StateMod is designed
and perhaps wish to contribute software code enhancements or otherwise provide input to the project.
This documentation is intended to provide sufficient information to software developers
to streamline understanding of the StateMod code and developer environment.
It is expected that software developers are technically competant and
follow conventions of the open source StateMod project.

**This documentation is a work in progress and will contain notes for inserts until resources can
be devoted to filling in blanks.**

## Colorado's Decision Support Systems

Colorado's Decision Support Systems ([CDSS, cdss.state.co.us](http://cdss.state.co.us))
has been developed to answer important questions about Colorado's water resources.
CDSS efforts are led by the [Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)](http://cwcb.state.co.us)
and [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us).

One component of CDSS is the StateMod water allocation model,
which simulates water system operations under Colorado's prior appropriation water right system.
Because Colorado's water systems are complex, StateMod software and datasets are also complex.

In late 2016, the Open Water Foundation began the effort to move StateMod and other CDSS software to open source licensing
and establish open source software projects, and this documentation is one project outcome.

## Open Water Foundation

The Open Water Foundation (OWF, [openwaterfoundation.org](http://openwaterfoundation.org)) is a 501(c)3 social enterprise
nonprofit that focuses on developing and supporting open source software to make better
decisions about water resources.  OWF is providing technical resources and management to
transition StateMod and other CDSS software to a sustainable open source project.

OWF has created this website as a prototype to facilitate helping people understand StateMod development issues
as the software moves to open source licensing.
