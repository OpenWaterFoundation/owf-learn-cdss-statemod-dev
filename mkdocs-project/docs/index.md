# Learn StateMod (for Software Developers)

## Introduction

This documentation is the developer manual for Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) StateMod Model.

If you are reading this documentation, you have an interest in learning how StateMod is designed
and perhaps wish to contribute software code enhancements or otherwise provide input to the project.
This documentation is intended to provide sufficient information to software developers
to streamline understanding of the StateMod code and developer environment.
It is expected that software developers are technically competant and
follow conventions of the open source StateMod project.

**This documentation is a work in progress and will contain notes for inserts until resources can
be devoted to filling in blanks.**

## Documentation Organization

The documentation is organized in the order of basic concepts and then topics relevant to develop StateMod.
